# sumo-traci-public-transport
This little projects shows, how the TraCI-API can be used to control traffic-lights in order to archieve less waiting times for public transport vehicles.

To use the program, you have to edit "traci.cfg.xml", which is the config for the program.

| Parameter Name | Describtion                                                                 | Value Type |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Port           | Port, that the TraCI Server shoulduse (when set to -1, it uses a free port) | int        |
| sumocfg        | Path of the simulation that shall be opened                                 | string     |
| sumoexe        | Path of the sumo application                                                | string     |

The program can handle multiple traffic-lights at the same time.

If the SUMO_HOME enivronment is set properly, you should not need to adapt the include and library paths. The compilation should work when using TraCI-Wildau.sln with Visual Studio or using cmake either with Visual Studio or on the command line.
To compile the project on Windows, make sure, you set the compiler to use ANSI-Libraries, because the TraCI-Library is using ANSI.

To run the simulation, simply run the resulting TraCIWildau-program.
